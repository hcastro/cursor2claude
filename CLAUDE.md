## 📋 Additional Guidelines
@.cursor/rules/core-rules/code-quality.mdc <!-- For maintaining code quality, documentation, and explanations -->
@.cursor/rules/core-rules/consult-planning-docs-agent.mdc <!-- This rule directs the agent to consult documents within the .cursor/planning/ directory when tasked with significant feature development, major design changes, or architectural modifications. These documents, typically Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) or design specifications, provide critical context on strategic direction, scope, and technical considerations for large-scale initiatives. Applying this rule ensures that the agent's contributions align with established plans, prevent redundant effort, and maintain consistency with the project's vision, especially before making substantial code alterations or proposing new architectural patterns. -->
@.cursor/rules/core-rules/rule-generator-agent.mdc
@.cursor/rules/tool-rules/git-commit-assistant.mdc <!-- Git Commit Assistant rule to enforce clean, structured, and traceable commit workflows. This rule should be applied whenever a developer attempts to stage or commit changes. It ensures that - Commits are grouped logically and use conventional commit messages tied to Jira tickets. - Feature branches are created from `development` with proper naming conventions. - No direct work is allowed on `master`. - Sensitive or excluded files (e.g., .env, secrets) are never accidentally committed. This rule improves collaboration, auditability, and consistency across the codebase, especially in team environments working within a CI/CD pipeline that tracks Jira tickets. -->
@.cursor/rules/tool-rules/task-list-management-agent.mdc <!-- Apply this rule when creating or managing task lists in markdown files to track project progress. This includes creating new task list files (TASKS.md or feature-specific names), updating task statuses, maintaining relevant files sections, and documenting implementation details. Use this rule when starting new features, implementing tasks, or when the user requests task tracking. The rule ensures consistent task list structure, proper maintenance of task states, and comprehensive documentation of implementation progress. -->

### MDC Frontmatter Schema

```typescript
interface RuleFrontmatter {
  description?: string // Used as section header
  globs?: string[] // File patterns for context-specific rules
  alwaysApply?: boolean // Places in Always-Apply section
  priority?: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' // Affects inline decision
  inline?: boolean // Forces inline rendering
}
```

## Important Implementation Details

- The tool creates example rules if `.cursor/rules/` doesn't exist to help users get started
- File paths in CLAUDE.md use relative paths from project root for portability
- The sync operation is idempotent - safe to run multiple times

## Testing Locally

When working on cursor2claude itself:

1. Make changes to `src/index.ts`
2. Run `pnpm build` to compile
3. Test with `pnpm dev sync` in this project
4. Create test `.cursor/rules/` in other projects to verify behavior
